HHblits databases
#################

HHblits needs an HMM-database containing of HHM- or HMMER-files for all database proteins (e.g. uniprot20_hhm_db) 
and a special cs-database-file for the fast prefilter (e.g. uniprot20.cs219). When performing more than 1 iteration 
of HHblits or when an alignment should be generated (i.e. -oa3m option), HHblits needs also an A3M-database 
containing A3M-alignments for each profile HMM (e.g. uniprot20_a3m_db).
Databases can be downloaded from our FTP-server (ftp://toolkit.lmb.uni-muenchen.de/HHblits/databases/).


HHblits libraries
#################

For running HHblits two library-files are needed. You can download them from our FTP-Server
(ftp://toolkit.lmb.uni-muenchen.de/HHblits/libs.tar.gz). 
The paths to these files need to be adapted in the default-file (.hhdefaults in the bin-directory).


Running HHblits
###############

HHblits reads default options and directory paths from the file ".hhdefaults" in the binaries directory. This file needs to 
be adapted. All default options can be overridden on the command line.

For performing a single search iteration of HHblits (corresponding to an HHsearch run with prefiltering), run HHblits 
with the following command:

$ bin/hhblits -i <input-file> -o <result-file> -n 1 -d <database-basename>

For generating an alignment of homologous sequences, we recommend the following options:

$ bin/hhblits -i <input-file> -o <result-file> -oa3m <result-alignment> -d <database-basename>

You can get a detailed list of options for HHblits by running HHblits with the "-h" option.
