Need to implement a new method
	
	Similar as center approach, but we will use hhsearch profile-profile
	alignment instead of muscle. Furthermore, we will complement the 
	hhsearch alignment with spem alignment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a construt version 2

generate hhsearch profile from msa and query

alignment query and center profile

Generate models from this alignment
	the changes must be made to both construct.pl and construct_hard.pl
	(the model will be selected based on model evaluation score
	of construct models based on central star only ----------- we have
	have only ten models to select. (or even just the center0 and 
	star0).
