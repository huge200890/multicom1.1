Adapted from construct approach

Use the state-of-the-art multiple sequence alignment approach to build
alignments for model generation

Use MSAprob, MSACompro, Promal, Promal3D if possible (Xin)

Use both Modeller and ModelGenerator to generate models (Jilong)

Use both new refinement approach if necessary? (Deb)  

But we need to figure out how to shorten the time?
