use psi-blast (first NR, then one round on pdb).

then use single template approach to generate one model for each top 
template that meets the pre-defined requirements.

check out the code in blast approach

create a new script: main_psiblast.pl

done.

to add into the meta system. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem:

	psiblast sometime generate exactly the same model as multicom (see
T0443)
	How to make them different? 
	change nr to cd-hit ones? 

	Also check MULTICOM-CMFR. to make one the same as it????
